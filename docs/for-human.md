# Creating Content for Humans

## `/for-human/learning/`

Tutorials/guides for complex concepts or synthesized research.

**Naming:** `[domain].topic.md`

Examples:

- `product-design.process.md`
- `engineering.testing.md`
- `ai-agents.context-structure.md`

## `/for-human/manuals/`

How-to guides for tools/processes humans maintain.

## `/for-human/tasks/`

Action items requiring human decision or follow-up.

**Critical rules:**

- `todo.md` and `todo.completed.md` are human's personal roadmap - agents NEVER modify these
- Agents create topic-specific task files: `setup.md`, `testing.md`, `[feature].md`
- Keep files small and focused (better clarity and effectiveness)
- Use same priority structure as todo.md (High/Medium/Low Priority)

## Content Standards

Keep all content concise (no comprehensive guides). Notify human, clear next steps, plain language, flag urgency.

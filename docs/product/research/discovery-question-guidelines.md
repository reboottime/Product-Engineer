## Core Principles (The Mom Test + JTBD)

### 1. Talk about their life, not your idea

**✅ Good:**
- "Walk me through what you did yesterday"
- "Tell me about the last time you needed to [accomplish task]"

**❌ Bad:**
- "Would you use a tool that does X?"
- "What do you think of this idea?"

### 2. Ask about specifics in the past, not opinions about the future

**✅ Good:**
- "Tell me about the last time this problem happened"
- "What did you do when X happened last Tuesday?"
- "Walk me through your workflow from last week"

**❌ Bad:**
- "How often do you think this happens?"
- "What would you do if X happened?"
- "Do you usually have this problem?"

**Why:** People are terrible at predicting their future behavior. Past actions are facts, future intentions are opinions.

### 3. Look for commitment and past actions, not compliments

**✅ Good:**
- "What have you already tried to solve this?"
- "Have you paid for solutions? How much?"
- "What workarounds have you built?"
- "Who have you asked for help?"

**❌ Bad:**
- "Would you pay for this?" (hypothetical)
- "Is this a good idea?" (fishing for validation)
- "Would this be useful?" (leading)

**Why:** Past spending of time/money proves the pain is real. Future promises are cheap.

### 4. Anchor in real stories, not generics

**✅ Good:**
- "Walk me through the workflow you used yesterday"
- "What happened the last 3 times you encountered this?"
- "Tell me the story of how you solved X last week"

**❌ Bad:**
- "How do you generally handle this?"
- "Do you have this problem?"
- "What do you typically do?"

**Why:** Generic answers hide the messy reality. Specific stories reveal actual behavior.

### 5. Understand switching costs and barriers

**✅ Good:**
- "What keeps you using [current solution]?"
- "What would you need to change to switch?"
- "What did you have to give up to use [current tool]?"
- "When was the last time you switched tools? What happened?"

**❌ Bad:**
- "Would you switch to something better?" (ignores switching costs)
- "Are you happy with your current solution?" (yes/no)

**Why:** Even bad solutions have inertia. You need to overcome switching costs to win customers.

## Interview Guide Structure

### 1. Problem Validation Questions (Specific Past Experiences)

**Goal:** Get 3+ specific stories about real occurrences

**Question types:**
- Workflow walkthrough (yesterday/last week)
- Last 3 times problem occurred (specific stories)
- What they did in response (actual behavior)
- Cost/impact of each occurrence (time/money/frustration)

**Probing follow-ups:**
- "What else?"
- "Tell me more about that"
- "Why did you do it that way?"
- "What happened next?"
- "How long did that take?"

### 2. Commitment Evidence Questions (What They've Already Done)

**Goal:** Find proof they've invested time/money/effort

**Key questions:**
- "What solutions have you already tried?"
- "How much time/money have you spent solving this?"
- "What workarounds have you built?"
- "Who have you asked for help?"
- "What research have you done?"

**Why it matters:** If they haven't tried to solve it, the pain isn't real enough.

### 3. Context Questions (Understand Their World)

**What to learn:**
- User role and responsibilities
- Decision-making authority and budget access
- Current tools and workflow
- Team structure and who else is affected
- Buying process (if B2B)

**Why it matters:** Context determines if they can actually buy/use your solution.

### 4. Jobs-to-be-Done Questions (Outcomes, Not Features)

**Goal:** Understand what they're trying to accomplish

**Key questions:**
- "What are you trying to accomplish when [problem occurs]?"
- "How do you measure success on this?"
- "What would 'done' look like?"
- "What would solving this enable you to do next?"
- "How do you want to feel when this is solved?"

**Why it matters:** People hire products to do a job. Understand the job, not the feature request.

### 5. Switching Costs Questions (Barriers to Change)

**Goal:** Understand what you're competing against (including inertia)

**Key questions:**
- "What keeps you using [current solution] despite the problems?"
- "What would you have to change or give up to switch?"
- "Who else would be affected if you changed approaches?"
- "What's the risk of trying something new here?"
- "When was the last time you switched tools in this category? How did it go?"

**Why it matters:** Switching costs can kill great products. Know what you're up against.

### 6. Prioritization Questions (Evidence-Based)

**Goal:** Understand urgency and ranking of problems

**Key questions:**
- "Which problem happened most often this week/month?" (frequency)
- "Which problem costs you the most time/money/opportunity?" (impact)
- "If you had a magic wand, what would you solve first?"
- "What problem are you actively trying to solve right now?"
- "Can we follow up in [timeframe] to see how [current approach] worked?"

**Why it matters:** Build for urgent, frequent, expensive problems first.

## Question Quality Checklist

Before asking any question, verify:

- [ ] **Past-focused?** Is it about what happened, not what might happen?
- [ ] **Specific?** Does it ask for a story, not a general opinion?
- [ ] **Behavioral?** Will it reveal actual behavior, not intended behavior?
- [ ] **Unbiased?** Does it avoid mentioning our solution or leading them?
- [ ] **Actionable?** Will the answer give us evidence to kill/pivot, not just validate?

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Never Ask:

❌ **"Would you use this?"** - Hypothetical, people lie about the future

❌ **"Is this a good idea?"** - Compliment-seeking, no useful information

❌ **"How much would you pay?"** - Meaningless without context of what they currently pay

❌ **"Do you have this problem?"** - Yes/no question, not specific enough

❌ **"Would this be useful?"** - Leading question, fishing for validation

❌ **"What features do you want?"** - Focuses on features, not problems

❌ **"How often does this happen?"** - Opinion about frequency, not real data

### Watch Out For:

⚠️ **Compliments** - "That's a great idea!" is worthless data

⚠️ **Generics** - "I usually..." or "Most of the time..." hides reality

⚠️ **Future promises** - "I would definitely use this" means nothing

⚠️ **Feature requests** - They're guessing at solutions, go deeper on the problem

⚠️ **Hypotheticals** - "If X happened, I'd do Y" is speculation

## Interview Techniques

### The "Tell me more" ladder

When you get a good answer, go deeper:

1. **Initial answer:** "I waste a lot of time on X"
2. **"Tell me more":** "What does that look like?"
3. **Get specific:** "When was the last time this happened?"
4. **Dig for story:** "Walk me through what happened"
5. **Find cost:** "How much time did you lose?"
6. **Understand attempts:** "What did you try to prevent it?"

Keep going until you have a concrete story with specifics.

### The "Last time" technique

Instead of: "Do you have problem X?"
Ask: "Tell me about the last time X happened"

This forces them to:
- Recall a specific instance (story, not opinion)
- Reveal whether it actually happens (if they can't remember, it's not frequent/important)
- Share real behavior (what they actually did, not what they think they'd do)

### The "Cost calculation" technique

Quantify the pain:

1. **Frequency:** "How many times did this happen last week?"
2. **Time cost:** "How long did it take to deal with?"
3. **Opportunity cost:** "What couldn't you do because of this?"
4. **Money cost:** "Did this cost you money? How much?"
5. **Emotional cost:** "How did this make you feel?"

Real pain has measurable costs.

### The "Commitment test"

Find out if they care enough to take action:

- "What have you done to solve this already?"
- "Have you looked for solutions? What did you find?"
- "Have you paid for anything to help with this?"
- "Have you built any workarounds yourself?"
- "Who have you talked to about this problem?"

If they've done nothing, the pain isn't real.

## What Good Looks Like

### Example: Bad Discovery Interview

**Interviewer:** "We're building a task manager for people with ADHD. Would you use something like that?"

**Customer:** "Oh yeah, that sounds great! I definitely need something like that."

**Interviewer:** "What features would be most important to you?"

**Customer:** "Probably calendar integration and mobile app."

**Interviewer:** "Would you pay $10/month for it?"

**Customer:** "Sure, I think so."

**❌ Result:** No useful information. All hypotheticals and compliments.

### Example: Good Discovery Interview

**Interviewer:** "Tell me about the last time you forgot to work on something important."

**Customer:** "Oh man, just yesterday. I was in a Zoom call and completely forgot about a deadline until my manager messaged me at 4pm. The task list was open in another window but I couldn't see it."

**Interviewer:** "What did you do when you got that message?"

**Customer:** "Panicked, switched windows, realized I had 2 hours of work to do before 5pm. Had to cancel another meeting and stay late."

**Interviewer:** "How often does something like this happen?"

**Customer:** "Let me think... it happened 3 times last week. Once with the same deadline issue, twice where I just forgot to check my list until end of day."

**Interviewer:** "What have you tried to solve this?"

**Customer:** "I tried keeping the task window in a separate desktop, but then I forget that desktop exists. I tried writing tasks on sticky notes on my monitor, but they fall off and I stop seeing them. I've looked at apps like Todoist and Things but they don't solve the visibility problem."

**Interviewer:** "Have you paid for any solutions?"

**Customer:** "I pay $5/month for Todoist Premium, but honestly I barely use it now because I have to remember to look at it."

**✅ Result:** Concrete problem (task list invisible during focused work), quantified frequency (3x/week), proven commitment ($5/month subscription + built workarounds), clear failure modes of existing solutions.

- ✅ They've spent time/money trying to solve it already
- ✅ You can quantify frequency and cost
- ✅ You understand why existing solutions fail
- ✅ You know what would need to change for them to switch

**How to know you're off track:**
- ❌ Everyone says it's a "great idea"
- ❌ You only have opinions about the future
- ❌ Nobody has tried to solve this yet
- ❌ You can't get specific stories
- ❌ You're asking about features, not problems
- ❌ You're avoiding questions that might invalidate your idea

**Remember:** The goal is to be right, not to feel good. Bad news early is good news.

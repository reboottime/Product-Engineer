# Shared Components

Reusable UI components with platform-agnostic specifications.

## Component Documentation

Each component should have:
- Visual examples
- States (default, hover, active, disabled, error)
- Accessibility requirements
- Usage guidelines
- Platform-specific adaptations

## Creating New Components

Use `_template.md` as a starting point for documenting new components.

# Onboarding Design Principles

Guide new users to their "aha!" moment—where they realize the app's value.

## Project Application

<!-- Update when: after user testing, pattern chosen, audience clarified -->

**Target Audience:** [Describe your users]

**Chosen Pattern:** [Which onboarding pattern and why]

**Adaptations:**
- [What principles we're emphasizing/de-emphasizing for our users]

**Learnings:**
- [Date] - [What we learned from testing/research and how it changed our approach]

---

## Core Goals

- **Educate**: Teach navigation and core functionality via interactive tutorials or step lists
- **Facilitate setup**: Guide account creation, permissions, basic info in user-friendly way
- **Personalize**: Let users tailor experience (topics, goals, notifications)
- **Drive retention**: Ensure users quickly understand how app solves their problems
- **Set positive tone**: Make good first impression—helpful, easy, worth their time

## Key Principles

1. **Focus on value, not features** - Demonstrate main benefit, don't showcase every feature
2. **Minimize upfront requests** - Avoid unnecessary info/permissions early; get users in quickly
3. **Match complexity to app** - Simple apps: 3-5 screens. Complex apps: progressive/contextual approach
4. **Make it interactive** - Use tutorials and prompts that encourage action, not static screens
5. **Always allow skipping** - Never force users through onboarding
6. **Test with users** - Refine flow based on real user feedback

## Onboarding Patterns

| Pattern | Best For | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Nickel Tour** | Simple apps | 3-5 screens: welcome, quick tips, engaging graphics |
| **Progressive** | Complex apps | Introduce features as user encounters them in-app |
| **Self-Select** | Diverse users | Let users choose their onboarding path based on needs |

## Screen Count Guidance

No "right" number—aim for **as few as possible** while still guiding to core value. Lengthy upfront tutorials overwhelm users; prefer contextual guidance.

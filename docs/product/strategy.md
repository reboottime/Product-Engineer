## Design Principles

[3-5 principles that guide product and design decisions]

1. **[Principle Name]:** [One sentence - what this means in practice]
2. **[Principle Name]:** [One sentence - what this means in practice]
3. **[Principle Name]:** [One sentence - what this means in practice]

<!-- Example:
1. **Visibility Over Integration:** Always-visible beats invisible automation—manual task entry is fine if it means tasks are always visible
2. **Trust Over Control:** Provide "I'm done" escape hatches—reinforce focus without creating rebellion
3. **Minimal Input Overhead:** Lower barrier than existing tools—3-5 tasks max, simple text entry
4. **Timer-Task Coupling:** Clicking task starts timer automatically—reduce decision fatigue
5. **Immediate Friction:** Block distraction sites instantly during timer—no "one quick check" loophole

## Problem & Solution

### The Problem

[2-3 sentences describing the core user pain point. Be specific about who experiences this and when.]

**User Impact:**
- Pain point 1
- Pain point 2
- Pain point 3

<!-- Example:
Knowledge workers with ADHD lose focus in fullscreen Chrome because task lists are invisible, leading to distraction on high-stimulation sites instead of completing priority work.

User Impact:
- Forget what they were working on mid-task
- Visit Twitter/Reddit "just to check" and lose 30+ minutes
- End workday having completed 0-1 tasks instead of 3-5
-->

### Our Solution

[2-3 sentences describing the solution approach. Focus on the key insight or unique approach.]

**Key Differentiators:**
- What makes this different from alternatives
- Why this approach will work when others haven't

<!-- Example:
Always-visible task overlay with 45-minute focus timer and distraction site blocker. Unlike existing tools, tasks remain visible in fullscreen mode and blocking allows "I'm done" escape to reinforce focus without rebellion.

Key Differentiators:
- Visibility in fullscreen (competitors: invisible in fullscreen)
- Trust-based blocking (competitors: hard blocks that users disable)
- Minimal input overhead (competitors: complex task management)
-->

### Future Vision

[1-2 sentences on where this is heading beyond current phase]

<!-- Example:
Expand to iPhone widgets for always-visible tasks on mobile. Create cross-platform sustainable focus system for ADHD knowledge workers.
-->

## Success Metrics

### North Star Metric

**[Metric Name]:** [Description of what this measures and why it matters]

<!-- Example:
**Tasks Completed Per Day:** Measures actual productivity impact, not just engagement. Captures whether users are completing priority work vs. getting distracted.
-->

### Phase-Specific Metrics

**Current Phase:** [Customer Discovery | POC | MVP | Production]

#### [Current Phase] Metrics

| Metric | Target | Baseline | Why This Matters |
|--------|--------|----------|------------------|
| [Metric 1] | [Target] | [Current] | [1 sentence rationale] |
| [Metric 2] | [Target] | [Current] | [1 sentence rationale] |
| [Metric 3] | [Target] | [Current] | [1 sentence rationale] |

<!-- Example for MVP:
| Metric | Target | Baseline | Why This Matters |
|--------|--------|----------|------------------|
| Tasks completed per day | 3+ | 0-1 | Core value delivery measure |
| Distraction site visits during timer | 0-1 | 5-10 | Measures focus improvement |
| Completed 45-min sessions per day | 2-3 | 0-1 | Validates timer pattern |
-->

### Success Criteria

**This phase is successful when:**

- [ ] [Criterion 1 - specific, measurable]
- [ ] [Criterion 2 - specific, measurable]
- [ ] [Criterion 3 - specific, measurable]

<!-- Example:
- [ ] Users complete 3+ tasks daily for 5 consecutive days
- [ ] Users do NOT disable the extension within first week
- [ ] 5+ users report "this actually helps me focus" feedback
-->

### Leading vs Lagging Indicators

**Leading Indicators** (predict future success):
- [Indicator 1] - [What it predicts]
- [Indicator 2] - [What it predicts]

**Lagging Indicators** (confirm past success):
- [Indicator 1] - [What it confirms]
- [Indicator 2] - [What it confirms]

<!-- Example:
Leading: Extension enabled daily (predicts retention), Tasks added (predicts completion)
Lagging: Tasks completed (confirms value), Extension still installed after 30 days (confirms retention)
-->

## Strategic Context

### Target Users

**Primary:** [Who is the core user? Be specific.]

**Characteristics:**
- [Characteristic 1]
- [Characteristic 2]
- [Characteristic 3]

**Jobs to be Done:**
When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].

<!-- Example:
Primary: Knowledge workers with ADHD working in Chrome fullscreen

Characteristics:
- Experience focus challenges, especially with high-stimulation websites
- Use task management tools but struggle to reference them during work
- Work primarily in fullscreen Chrome (developers, writers, researchers)

Jobs to be Done:
When working in fullscreen mode, I want to see what I should be working on, so I can stay on track instead of getting distracted.
-->

### Market Context

**Alternatives & Why They Fall Short:**

1. **[Alternative 1]** - [Why users don't stick with it]
2. **[Alternative 2]** - [Why users don't stick with it]
3. **[Alternative 3]** - [Why users don't stick with it]

**Our Insight:** [What do you understand about this problem that others don't?]

<!-- Example:
1. **Tana/Notion** - Tasks invisible in fullscreen Chrome, high input overhead
2. **Focus@Will, Brain.fm** - No task visibility, no distraction blocking
3. **Cold Turkey, Freedom** - Hard blocks create rebellion, users disable

Our Insight: ADHD users need visibility + trust-based blocking, not invisible automation or hard control.

**Success:** [Criteria for moving to POC]

### POC (Proof of Concept)
**Goal:** Validate core technical feasibility
**Success:** [Criteria for moving to MVP]

### MVP
**Goal:** Validate solution actually helps users
**Success:** [Criteria for moving to Production]

### Production
**Goal:** Scale to wider audience
**Success:** [Criteria for mature product]

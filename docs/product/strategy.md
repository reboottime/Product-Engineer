# Product Strategy

**For:** Product Manager and Product Design Lead agents
**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

---

## Quick Reference

**Problem:** [One sentence - what core pain are we solving for whom?]

**Audience:** [One sentence - who experiences this problem?]

**Key Constraints:**

- [Constraint 1 - technical, business, or user limitation]
- [Constraint 2]
- [Constraint 3]

<!-- Example:
Problem: Real estate agents waste 10+ hours/week manually tracking which leads are ready to buy because CRMs don't surface behavior signals
Audience: Residential real estate agents managing 50+ active leads simultaneously
Key Constraints:
- Must integrate with existing CRM (agents won't switch systems)
- Mobile-first (agents work on-the-go)
- Zero manual data entry (agents won't update two systems)
-->

## Design Principles

[3-5 principles that guide product and design decisions]

1. **[Principle Name]:** [One sentence - what this means in practice]
2. **[Principle Name]:** [One sentence - what this means in practice]
3. **[Principle Name]:** [One sentence - what this means in practice]

<!-- Example:
1. **Behavior Over Self-Reporting:** Prioritize leads based on actions (property views, response speed) not manual scoring
2. **Mobile-First:** All critical actions available on mobile—agents rarely sit at desks
3. **Integration Over Replacement:** Layer on existing CRM rather than requiring migration
4. **Proactive Alerts:** Surface hot leads automatically—don't make agents hunt
5. **Context at a Glance:** Show why a lead is hot (3 property views today, fast replies) not just a score
-->

## Problem & Solution

### The Problem

[2-3 sentences describing the core user pain point. Be specific about who experiences this and when.]

**User Impact:**

- Pain point 1
- Pain point 2
- Pain point 3

<!-- Example:
Real estate agents managing 50+ leads manually track engagement signals (property views, email replies, showing requests) across multiple tools, missing hot leads who are ready to buy while spending time on cold prospects.

User Impact:
- Lose deals to faster-responding competitors (hot leads go cold in 24-48 hours)
- Waste 10+ hours/week chasing cold leads while hot leads go ignored
- Can't scale beyond 50 leads without missing opportunities
-->

### Our Solution

[2-3 sentences describing the solution approach. Focus on the key insight or unique approach.]

**Key Differentiators:**

- What makes this different from alternatives
- Why this approach will work when others haven't

<!-- Example:
AI-powered lead prioritization that automatically surfaces hot leads based on behavioral signals (property views, response times, showing requests) with mobile-first alerts. Unlike CRM scoring, no manual input required—analyzes existing data.

Key Differentiators:
- Zero manual data entry (competitors: require agents to score leads manually)
- Behavioral signals (competitors: rely on demographic data or self-reporting)
- Mobile-first alerts (competitors: desktop dashboards agents don't check)
-->

### Future Vision

[1-2 sentences on where this is heading beyond current phase]

<!-- Example:
Expand to predictive buyer personas and automated nurture sequences. Create end-to-end lead-to-close intelligence platform for solo agents and small teams.
-->

---

## Success Metrics

### North Star Metric

**[Metric Name]:** [Description of what this measures and why it matters]

<!-- Example:
**Hot Leads Contacted Within 2 Hours:** Measures speed-to-contact for high-intent leads. Directly correlates with close rate—hot leads who wait >24hrs convert 60% less.
-->

### Phase-Specific Metrics

**Current Phase:** [Customer Discovery | POC | MVP | Production]

#### [Current Phase] Metrics

| Metric | Target | Baseline | Why This Matters |
|--------|--------|----------|------------------|
| [Metric 1] | [Target] | [Current] | [1 sentence rationale] |
| [Metric 2] | [Target] | [Current] | [1 sentence rationale] |
| [Metric 3] | [Target] | [Current] | [1 sentence rationale] |

<!-- Example for MVP:
| Metric | Target | Baseline | Why This Matters |
|--------|--------|----------|------------------|
| Hot leads contacted within 2hrs | 80%+ | 20-30% | Core value delivery measure |
| Deals closed from hot lead alerts | 2-3/month | 0-1 | Validates lead quality |
| Time spent on cold leads | <3hrs/week | 10+ | Measures efficiency gain |
-->

### Success Criteria

**This phase is successful when:**

- [ ] [Criterion 1 - specific, measurable]
- [ ] [Criterion 2 - specific, measurable]
- [ ] [Criterion 3 - specific, measurable]

<!-- Example:
- [ ] Agents close 1+ deal directly attributed to hot lead alert within 30 days
- [ ] Agents check the app daily for 2+ weeks without prompting
- [ ] 5+ agents report "caught a lead I would have missed" feedback
-->

### Leading vs Lagging Indicators

**Leading Indicators** (predict future success):

- [Indicator 1] - [What it predicts]
- [Indicator 2] - [What it predicts]

**Lagging Indicators** (confirm past success):

- [Indicator 1] - [What it confirms]
- [Indicator 2] - [What it confirms]

<!-- Example:
Leading: Daily app opens (predicts engagement), Hot lead alerts clicked (predicts contact rate)
Lagging: Deals closed from alerts (confirms value), Still using after 60 days (confirms retention)
-->

## Strategic Context

### Target Users

**Primary:** [Who is the core user? Be specific.]

**Characteristics:**

- [Characteristic 1]
- [Characteristic 2]
- [Characteristic 3]

**Jobs to be Done:**
When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].

<!-- Example:
Primary: Residential real estate agents (solo or small teams) managing 30-100+ active leads

Characteristics:
- Spend 60%+ of work time away from desk (showings, open houses, networking)
- Use CRM inconsistently due to manual data entry overhead
- Close 1-2 deals/month, need 3-4 to hit income goals

Jobs to be Done:
When a lead shows high buying intent, I want to know immediately so I can follow up before competitors, increasing my close rate without working more hours.
-->

### Market Context

**Alternatives & Why They Fall Short:**

1. **[Alternative 1]** - [Why users don't stick with it]
2. **[Alternative 2]** - [Why users don't stick with it]
3. **[Alternative 3]** - [Why users don't stick with it]

**Our Insight:** [What do you understand about this problem that others don't?]

<!-- Example:
1. **Salesforce/HubSpot CRM** - Lead scoring requires manual updates agents don't do
2. **Follow Up Boss** - Good automation but no behavioral intelligence, treats all leads equally
3. **BoomTown/Ylopo** - Focused on lead generation, not prioritization of existing leads

Our Insight: Agents need zero-input behavioral intelligence, not another system requiring manual updates or lead gen they can't handle.
-->

## Open Questions & Assumptions

### Critical Assumptions

**Assumption 2:** [Statement]

- How to validate: [Test]
- Risk if wrong: [Impact]

<!-- Example:
Assumption: Agents have sufficient lead volume (30+ active leads) to benefit from prioritization
- Validate: Interview agents, check average lead pipeline size in POC
- Risk: If wrong, need to pivot to lead generation or target higher-volume agents only
-->

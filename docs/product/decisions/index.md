## Instructions

This index is automatically maintained by the `product-manager` agent when running `/pm.doc-decision`.

The index extracts frontmatter from all decision files (format: `YYYY-MM-DD.[topic].md`) and organizes them by type, status, and impact.

**File naming:** `YYYY-MM-DD.[topic].md` (decisions are time-bound)

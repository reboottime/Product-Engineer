# Anchor

A template repository for organizing AI-assisted software projects. Provides structured folders, custom agents, and slash commands to streamline product development with AI collaboration.

## What's Included

**Custom AI Agents:**
- Product Manager - Feature validation, roadmap planning, PRDs
- Product Design Lead - UX flows, wireframes, design specs
- Release Manager - Git workflows, commits, pull requests

**Slash Commands:**
- `/pm.*` - Product management workflows (validate features, write PRDs, plan roadmap)
- `/design.*` - Design workflows (flows, wireframes, specs)
- `/git.*` - Git operations (commits, PRs)
- `/marketing.*` - Marketing materials (landing pages)

**Folder Structure:**
```
/codebase/          # Your application code
/.claude/           # Custom agents and commands
/docs/              # AI agent documentation (product, technical)
/for-human/         # Human-facing materials (tasks, learning, manuals)
```

## Quick Start

1. **Clone or download this template**
   ```sh
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd anchor
   ```

2. **Customize CLAUDE.md**
   - Update project overview and north star
   - Adjust communication preferences
   - Add custom agents if needed

3. **Start using slash commands**
   ```
   /pm.define-project-context     # Set up product strategy
   /pm.propose-feature [idea]     # Evaluate a feature idea
   /design.flow [feature-name]    # Design user flows
   /git.add-pr                    # Create pull request
   ```

4. **Add your codebase**
   - Place code in `/codebase/[platform-name]/`
   - Add technical docs to `/docs/technical/`
   - Add product docs to `/docs/product/`

## How It Works

**For AI Agents:**
- `CLAUDE.md` provides universal context for all agents
- `/docs/` contains specialized documentation agents reference
- Custom agents in `/.claude/agents/` extend capabilities
- Slash commands in `/.claude/commands/` define workflows

**For Humans:**
- `/for-human/tasks/` - Action items requiring human completion
- `/for-human/learning/` - Guides and tutorials generated by AI
- `/for-human/manuals/` - How-to documentation for tools and processes

## Documentation

- **Agent Workflows:** See `/for-human/manuals/` for how to work with product and design agents
- **Learning Materials:** Check `/for-human/learning/` for guides on design principles, agent evaluation, etc.
- **Customization:** Modify `/.claude/` files to add agents or commands specific to your project

## Philosophy

This template assumes:
- AI agents are active collaborators in your development process
- Clear structure reduces context overhead and improves AI output
- Separation of AI docs (`/docs/`) and human materials (`/for-human/`) keeps both focused
- Custom agents and commands codify your team's workflows

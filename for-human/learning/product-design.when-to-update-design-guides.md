# When to Update Design Guides

Design guides are living documents, but updating them at the wrong time wastes effort. Here's when each type of guide naturally needs attention.

## The Trigger Pattern

Don't update guides on a schedule. Update when you observe friction:

- Users struggling with something you thought was clear
- Team members making inconsistent decisions
- Same question asked twice by different people

If nobody's confused and things work, the guide is fine.

## By Guide Type

### Onboarding Guide

**When:** After watching 3+ users go through your onboarding

**Triggers:**
- Users drop off at a specific step
- Users ask "what do I do now?"
- Users skip to wrong feature first
- Time-to-value is longer than expected

**Too early:** Before you have real users testing real flows

### Design Principles

**When:** After shipping 2-3 features

**Triggers:**
- Two designers made different choices for similar problems
- You find yourself explaining the same rationale repeatedly
- Code review reveals inconsistent UI patterns

**Too early:** Before you have multiple features to compare

### Accessibility Guidelines

**When:** When expanding beyond early adopters

**Triggers:**
- User reports they can't use your product (vision, motor, etc.)
- Entering regulated market (government, healthcare, education)
- International expansion (different devices, connection speeds)
- Usability testing reveals issues you didn't anticipate

**Too early:** During discovery when you're still validating the problem exists

### Platform Guidelines

**When:** When adding a new platform or major OS update

**Triggers:**
- Launching on second platform (web → mobile, extension → desktop app)
- Platform API changes break existing patterns
- Users on different platforms expect different behaviors

**Too early:** When you only have one platform

## Early-Stage Reality

In customer discovery and MVP phases, most guides stay untouched. This is correct.

**Your focus order:**
1. First, learn if the problem is real (no guides needed)
2. Then, build something testable (minimal guides)
3. Then, test with users (onboarding guide starts evolving)
4. Then, iterate on feedback (principles start forming)
5. Then, scale (accessibility and platform guides matter)

Premature documentation is waste. Let guides emerge from real friction.

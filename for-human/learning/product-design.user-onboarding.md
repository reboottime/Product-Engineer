# User Onboarding

The purpose of the onboarding process in an application is to guide new users through the app's features, help them understand its value, and encourage long-term engagement and retention. It involves an initial setup and a guided tour to get users to their "aha!" moment, where they realize the app's value, by educating, setting up preferences, and personalizing the experience.

## Core purposes of app onboarding

- **Educate users**: Teach users how to navigate the app and use its core functionalities. This can be done through interactive tutorials, feature tours, or a list of steps to follow.
- **Facilitate setup**: Guide users through the initial setup process, which can include creating accounts, granting permissions, or entering basic information in a user-friendly way.
- **Personalize the experience**: Allow users to tailor the app to their specific needs, such as selecting topics of interest, setting goals, or enabling relevant notifications.
- **Drive value and retention**: Ensure users quickly understand how the app solves their problems and provides value, which increases the likelihood they will continue to use it and become loyal customers.
- **Set a positive tone**: Make a good first impression by showing users that the app is helpful, easy to use, and worth their time. This first impression can set the tone for their entire journey with the product.

## Onboarding Screens: Examples to Set Users Up for Success

There is no single "right" number of onboarding screens; instead, aim for as few as possible while still guiding the user to the app's core value. For a simple app, a "quickstart" approach with 3-5 screens is often sufficient for welcome messages and quick tips. For more complex apps, a "progressive onboarding" method that introduces features as the user encounters them is more effective than a lengthy upfront tutorial.

### Key considerations

- **Focus on value, not features**: Instead of showing off every feature, focus on demonstrating the main benefit to the user, says UserGuiding.
- **Minimize upfront requests**: Avoid asking for unnecessary information or permissions early on. Get users into the app quickly.
- **Consider your app's complexity**: A simple app can use a few screens, while a complex one might need a more "in-app" or "as you go" approach to avoid overwhelming users.
- **Make it interactive**: Instead of static screens, use interactive elements like tutorials or prompts that encourage the user to take action.
- **Allow skipping**: Always give users the option to skip the onboarding process, notes ProAndroidDev.
- **Test with users**: Use user feedback to refine the onboarding flow and ensure it is clear and effective.

### Examples of onboarding flows

- **The "Nickel Tour"**: 3-5 screens for welcome messages, quick tips, and engaging graphics for simple apps.
- **Progressive Onboarding**: Introduce features as the user encounters them within the app itself, which is ideal for more complex applications.
- **Self-Select**: Allow users to choose their own onboarding path based on their needs.

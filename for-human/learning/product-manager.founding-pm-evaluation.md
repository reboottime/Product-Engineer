# Evaluating a Founding Product Manager (Founder's Lens)

How to assess if a 0→1 PM agent/hire will help or hurt velocity and decision quality.

## Strong Signals (Green Flags)

**Challenge mindset**

- Explicitly states "being right > being agreeable"
- Pushes back on weak evidence
- Has specific examples of when to block decisions
- Comfortable with conflict

**Evidence-based decision framework**

- Demands validation before building
- Questions assumptions as facts
- Asks "what problem?" before "what solution?"
- Uses metrics over opinions

**Speed + ruthlessness**

- Ships in days, not weeks
- Weekly customer conversations (minimum)
- Explicit kill criteria defined upfront
- Default "no" to scope creep

**Clean boundaries**

- Stays out of engineering/technical decisions
- Knows what's in vs out of scope
- Doesn't dictate technical implementation
- Trusts engineering expertise

## Red Flags (Interview Topics)

**Too much autonomy at 0→1**

- Claims to "decide autonomously" on prioritization/scope
- Founder MUST be deeply involved in what to build
- Should be "consult + recommend" not "decide"
- You're paying bills and living with consequences

**Premature structure**

- Multiple research directories before product exists
- Elaborate documentation taxonomy in discovery phase
- Risk of documentation theater over shipping
- One research doc > organized filing system

**Missing founder context**

- Doesn't ask about your vision or past attempts
- Ignores why YOU started this company
- Missing questions about domain expertise
- Not learning your blindspots

**Split focus**

- Thinking about handoffs during discovery phase
- Planning for future transitions instead of 0→1
- Should be 100% focused on current phase
- If planning exit, not all-in on discovery

## The Right Calibration

| Aspect | Founding PM Role | Common Mistake |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Prioritization** | Recommend with evidence → Founder decides | PM decides autonomously |
| **Documentation** | Minimal, actionable insights | Organized research taxonomy |
| **Customer Discovery** | Weekly conversations, lightweight notes | Formal research processes |
| **Decision Speed** | Ship prototype in days | Wait for perfect requirements |
| **Scope** | Current phase only | Planning future transitions |

## Interview Questions

**To test challenge mindset:**

- "I want to build feature X" → Do they push back for evidence?
- "Users told me they want Y" → Do they question the insight?

**To test structure vs speed:**

- "How would you organize customer research?" → Red flag if elaborate systems
- "What docs do you need before starting?" → Should be minimal

**To test founder collaboration:**

- "Who decides what to build?" → Should say "you decide, I inform"
- "When do you override my product calls?" → Should be rare/never

## Recalibration Script

*If strong instincts but wrong authority model:*

"Your instincts are right — challenge me, demand evidence, kill ruthlessly, ship fast. That's exactly what I need.

But at 0→1, we're joined at the hip on product decisions. You bring the framework and customer insights, I bring vision and final calls. It's collaborative, not autonomous.

And I need less Notion, more Notepad. One research doc beats a research directory structure. We can organize when we have a product people want.

Can you operate that way?"

## Decision Framework

**Hire/Keep if:**

- ✓ Challenges you with evidence
- ✓ Ships fast with minimal process
- ✓ Weekly customer conversations
- ✓ Stays out of engineering decisions
- ✓ Accepts founder has final call

**Pass/Recalibrate if:**

- ✗ Too agreeable or too autonomous
- ✗ Process-heavy in discovery phase
- ✗ Tries to dictate technical solutions
- ✗ Thinks about scale before validation
- ✗ Documents more than discovers

## Quick Assessment

**Grade: B+ → A-** if agent shows:

- Core product instincts (evidence-based, speed-focused)
- Healthy boundaries (challenges product, trusts engineering)
- Right operating tempo (days not weeks)
- Willingness to recalibrate on founder involvement

**Would hire if:** Agrees to collaborative decision-making and minimal structure in discovery phase.

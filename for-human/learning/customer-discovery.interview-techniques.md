# Customer Discovery Interview Techniques

**What this teaches:** How to conduct customer discovery interviews that uncover real needs (not false validation)

**Based on:** The Mom Test (Rob Fitzpatrick) + Jobs-to-be-Done (Clayton Christensen)

**Why it matters:** Bad interviews → build products nobody wants. Good interviews → find urgent problems worth solving.

## The Problem with Most Customer Interviews

### What Usually Happens

You: "I'm building a task manager for ADHD. Would you use it?"

Them: "Oh yeah, that sounds great!"

You: "What features would you want?"

Them: "Calendar integration and mobile app."

You: "Would you pay $10/month?"

Them: "Sure!"

**Result:** You feel validated. You build it. Nobody uses it.

### Why This Fails

1. **Hypotheticals are lies** - People can't predict their future behavior
2. **Compliments are worthless** - "Sounds great!" tells you nothing
3. **Feature requests are guesses** - They're solving for symptoms, not root causes
4. **No proof of pain** - If they haven't tried to solve it, it's not urgent

---

## The Five Core Principles

### 1. Talk About Their Life, Not Your Idea

**❌ Don't:** "I'm building X. Would you use it?"

**✅ Do:** "Walk me through what you did yesterday"

**Why:** The moment you mention your idea, they switch to "be nice" mode. You want to observe their real world, not their politeness.

**Example:**
- ❌ "Would you use a tool that shows tasks on your screen?"
- ✅ "Tell me about the last time you forgot to work on something important"

### 2. Ask About the Past, Not the Future

**❌ Don't:** "How often would you use this?" "What would you do if...?"

**✅ Do:** "When did this last happen?" "What did you actually do?"

**Why:** Past = facts. Future = fiction. People are terrible at predicting their behavior.

**Example:**
- ❌ "Would you use this daily?"
- ✅ "How many times did this problem happen last week?"

### 3. Look for Commitment, Not Compliments

**❌ Don't:** "Is this a good idea?" "Would you pay for this?"

**✅ Do:** "What have you tried already?" "Have you paid for solutions?"

**Why:** Past spending (time or money) proves the pain is real. Future promises are cheap.

**Example:**
- ❌ "Would you pay $10/month for this?"
- ✅ "What solutions have you already paid for? How much?"

### 4. Get Stories, Not Opinions

**❌ Don't:** "Do you generally have this problem?" "How do you usually handle it?"

**✅ Do:** "Tell me about the last time this happened" "Walk me through what happened"

**Why:** Generic opinions hide reality. Specific stories reveal actual behavior.

**Example:**
- ❌ "Do you often forget tasks?"
- ✅ "Tell me about the last time you forgot an important task. What happened?"

### 5. Understand Switching Costs

**❌ Don't:** "Would you switch from your current tool?"

**✅ Do:** "What keeps you using your current solution?" "What would you have to change?"

**Why:** Even terrible solutions have inertia. You need to understand what you're competing against.

**Example:**
- ❌ "If we built something better, would you switch?"
- ✅ "What keeps you using Todoist even though you said it doesn't solve your problem?"

## The Six-Part Interview Structure

### Part 1: Problem Validation (Get Specific Stories)

**Goal:** Collect 3+ specific instances of the problem occurring

**How to ask:**
- "Tell me about the last time this problem happened"
- "Walk me through your workflow from yesterday"
- "What happened the last 3 times you encountered this?"

**Follow up with:**
- "What did you do?" (actual behavior)
- "How long did that take?" (quantify cost)
- "What was the impact?" (understand severity)
- "What else?" (keep them talking)

**What you're looking for:**
- Specific dates/times ("last Tuesday at 3pm")
- Real actions taken (not what they "usually" do)
- Concrete costs (2 hours lost, $500 mistake, missed deadline)

**Red flag:** They can't remember a specific time = not frequent/painful enough

### Part 2: Commitment Evidence (Prove They Care)

**Goal:** Find proof they've already tried to solve this

**How to ask:**
- "What have you already tried to solve this?"
- "Have you paid for any solutions? Which ones?"
- "What workarounds have you built yourself?"
- "Who have you asked for help?"
- "What research have you done?"

**What you're looking for:**
- Money spent ($5/month subscription, $50 one-time purchase)
- Time invested (built a spreadsheet, created a system)
- Multiple attempts (tried 3 different apps)
- Active searching (Google searches, asking colleagues)

**Red flag:** "Haven't really tried anything" = not painful enough to matter

### Part 3: Context Questions (Understand Their World)

**Goal:** Learn if they can actually buy/use your solution

**What to learn:**
- Role and responsibilities (are they the end user?)
- Decision authority (can they purchase?)
- Budget access (how much can they spend without approval?)
- Current tools (what's in their stack?)
- Team structure (who else is involved?)
- Buying process (how do they evaluate/purchase tools?)

**Why it matters:** Your product might be great but they can't buy it, won't adopt it, or aren't the decision maker.

### Part 4: Jobs-to-be-Done (Outcomes, Not Features)

**Goal:** Understand what they're trying to accomplish

**How to ask:**
- "What are you trying to accomplish when [problem occurs]?"
- "How do you measure success?"
- "What would 'done' look like?"
- "What would solving this enable you to do next?"
- "How do you want to feel when this works?"

**Framework:**
- **Functional job:** Tasks to complete ("stay on top of commitments")
- **Emotional job:** How they want to feel ("feel in control, not overwhelmed")
- **Social job:** How they want to be perceived ("be seen as reliable")

**Why it matters:** People don't buy features, they hire products to do a job. Understand the job, not the feature request.

### Part 5: Switching Costs (What You're Competing Against)

**Goal:** Understand barriers to adoption

**How to ask:**
- "What keeps you using [current solution] despite the problems?"
- "What would you have to change to switch to something new?"
- "Who else would be affected by changing your approach?"
- "What's the risk of trying something new here?"
- "When was the last time you switched tools? How did that go?"

**What you're competing against:**
- **Inertia:** Current solution is "good enough"
- **Integration:** Connected to other tools/workflows
- **Learning curve:** Don't want to relearn something
- **Team adoption:** Other people use it too
- **Data migration:** Pain of moving data over
- **Previous bad experiences:** Last time they switched it was a disaster

**Why it matters:** Your product can be 10x better but if switching costs are high, they won't move.

### Part 6: Prioritization (Rank by Evidence)

**Goal:** Understand which problems matter most

**How to ask:**
- "Which problem happened most often last week?" (frequency)
- "Which problem costs you the most time/money?" (impact)
- "If you could solve one thing with a magic wand, what would it be?"
- "What problem are you actively trying to solve right now?"

**How to calculate priority:**
- **Frequency:** Daily = 10, Weekly = 7, Monthly = 3, Rarely = 1
- **Impact:** Hours lost, money lost, opportunities missed
- **Priority score:** Frequency × Impact

**Example:**
- Problem A: Happens 3x/week (7), costs 30 min each (1.5 hrs/week) = Priority 10.5
- Problem B: Happens 1x/month (3), costs 4 hours (4 hrs/month ≈ 1 hr/week) = Priority 3

**Why it matters:** Build for frequent, expensive problems first.

## Interview Techniques That Work

### The "Tell Me More" Ladder

When you get an interesting answer, go deeper:

1. **Initial answer:** "I waste a lot of time on X"
2. **"Tell me more":** You: "Tell me more about that"
3. **Get specific:** You: "When was the last time this happened?"
4. **Story time:** You: "Walk me through what happened"
5. **Quantify:** You: "How much time did you lose?"
6. **Find attempts:** You: "What did you try to prevent it?"

**Keep going until:** You have a specific story with concrete costs and actions taken.

### The "Last Time" Technique

**Instead of:** "Do you have problem X?" (yes/no)

**Ask:** "Tell me about the last time X happened" (story)

**What this does:**
- Forces them to recall a specific instance
- Reveals if it actually happens (can't remember = not frequent)
- Shows real behavior (what they did, not what they think they'd do)
- Surfaces unexpected details

**Example conversation:**

You: "Tell me about the last time you forgot to work on something important"

Them: "Hmm, let me think... Oh yeah, just yesterday actually"

You: "What happened?"

Them: "I was in a Zoom call and my manager messaged me asking about a report. I'd completely forgotten it was due at 5pm"

You: "What did you do?"

Them: "Had to cancel another meeting, rushed through it, stayed late to finish"

You: "How often does this kind of thing happen?"

Them: "Let me check my calendar... looks like at least 2-3 times per week"

**Note:** They couldn't estimate frequency until you asked about a specific instance.

### The "Cost Calculator" Technique

Quantify the pain in concrete terms:

1. **Frequency:** "How many times did this happen last week/month?"
2. **Time cost:** "How long did it take to deal with each time?"
3. **Opportunity cost:** "What couldn't you do because you were dealing with this?"
4. **Money cost:** "Did this cost money? How much?"
5. **Emotional cost:** "How did this make you feel?"

**Example:**

Problem: Forgetting tasks due to hidden task list

- Frequency: 3 times per week
- Time cost: 30 min to context switch + 1 hour to rush
- Opportunity cost: Missed focused work time, canceled meetings
- Emotional cost: Anxiety, feeling unreliable
- **Total:** ~4.5 hours/week + stress

**Why it matters:** Real problems have measurable costs. If they can't quantify it, it might not be real.

### The "Commitment Test"

Find out if they care enough to have taken action:

**Questions to ask:**
- "What have you done to solve this already?"
- "Have you looked for solutions? What did you find?"
- "Have you paid for anything to help?"
- "Have you built workarounds?"
- "Who have you asked for help?"

**Scoring:**
- **High commitment:** Spent money ($5+/month), built workarounds, tried 3+ solutions
- **Medium commitment:** Free trials, asked colleagues, did some research
- **Low commitment:** "Haven't really tried anything"

**If low commitment:** The pain isn't real enough to matter. Move on.

## What Good vs. Bad Looks Like

### Bad Interview Example

**You:** "We're building a task manager for people with ADHD. Would you use it?"

**Them:** "Oh yeah, that sounds great! I definitely need something like that."

**You:** "What features would be most important?"

**Them:** "Probably calendar integration and a mobile app."

**You:** "Would you pay $10/month?"

**Them:** "Sure, I think so."

**You:** "Great! Thanks for the feedback!"

**❌ What's wrong:**
- Only hypotheticals ("would you")
- Compliments ("sounds great")
- Feature requests (not problems)
- No proof of pain
- No evidence they'd actually pay
- You learned nothing actionable

### Good Interview Example

**You:** "Tell me about the last time you forgot to work on something important."

**Them:** "Oh man, just yesterday. I was in a Zoom call and completely forgot about a deadline until my manager messaged me at 4pm."

**You:** "What happened when you got that message?"

**Them:** "Panicked, switched windows, realized I had 2 hours of work left. Had to cancel another meeting and stay late."

**You:** "That sounds frustrating. How often does something like this happen?"

**Them:** "Let me think... at least 3 times last week. Once with a deadline like this, twice where I just forgot to check my task list until end of day."

**You:** "What have you tried to solve this?"

**Them:** "I tried keeping my task window on a separate desktop, but then I forget that desktop exists. Tried sticky notes on my monitor but they fall off. I've looked at apps like Todoist and Things but they don't solve the visibility problem."

**You:** "Have you paid for any of those solutions?"

**Them:** "I pay $5/month for Todoist Premium, but honestly I barely use it now because I have to remember to look at it."

**You:** "What keeps you using Todoist even though it's not solving the problem?"

**Them:** "All my tasks are in there. Moving to something else sounds exhausting. Plus last time I switched task apps I lost a bunch of data."

**✅ What's right:**
- Asked about specific past event
- Got a real story with details
- Quantified frequency (3x/week)
- Found proof of commitment ($5/month + built workarounds)
- Understood switching costs (data migration pain)
- Learned why existing solutions fail
- Can now decide if this is worth solving

## Red Flags: What to Avoid

### Never Ask These Questions

❌ **"Would you use this?"**
- Why: Hypothetical, people lie about the future
- Ask instead: "What have you tried already?"

❌ **"Is this a good idea?"**
- Why: Compliment-seeking, no useful info
- Ask instead: "Tell me about the last time this happened"

❌ **"How much would you pay?"**
- Why: Meaningless without context
- Ask instead: "What do you currently pay for solutions?"

❌ **"Do you have this problem?"**
- Why: Yes/no, not specific enough
- Ask instead: "When was the last time this happened?"

❌ **"Would this be useful?"**
- Why: Leading, fishing for validation
- Ask instead: "What are you trying to accomplish?"

❌ **"What features do you want?"**
- Why: They're guessing at solutions
- Ask instead: "What problem are you trying to solve?"

### Watch Out For These Answers

⚠️ **"That's a great idea!"**
- This is: A compliment, worthless data
- Follow up with: "Tell me about the last time you had this problem"

⚠️ **"I usually..."** or **"Most of the time..."**
- This is: Generic opinion, hiding reality
- Follow up with: "What specifically happened yesterday?"

⚠️ **"I would definitely use this"**
- This is: Future promise, meaningless
- Follow up with: "What solutions have you already tried?"

⚠️ **"I want it to have X feature"**
- This is: Solution guessing, not problem discovery
- Follow up with: "What are you trying to accomplish?"

⚠️ **"If X happened, I'd do Y"**
- This is: Hypothetical speculation
- Follow up with: "When did X last happen? What did you actually do?"

## How to Know You're Doing It Right

### ✅ Good Signs

You're on the right track if:

- You have 3+ specific stories with dates/times
- They've already spent time or money trying to solve this
- You can quantify frequency (X times per week) and cost (Y hours/dollars)
- You understand why existing solutions fail
- You know what would need to change for them to switch
- You could kill your idea based on what you learned

### ❌ Bad Signs

You're off track if:

- Everyone says it's a "great idea" (compliments)
- You only have opinions about the future (hypotheticals)
- Nobody has tried to solve this yet (no commitment)
- You can't get specific stories (too generic)
- You're asking about features, not problems
- You're avoiding questions that might invalidate your idea

## Practice Exercise

### Scenario

You want to build a tool to help remote workers feel less isolated.

### Bad Questions (Don't Use These)

1. Would you use a tool that helps you feel connected to coworkers?
2. Do you feel isolated working remotely?
3. What features would you want in a remote connection tool?
4. Would you pay $15/month for this?

### Good Questions (Use These Instead)

1. "Tell me about the last time you felt disconnected from your team"
2. "Walk me through your typical workday yesterday - who did you interact with?"
3. "What have you tried to stay connected with coworkers?"
4. "Have you paid for any tools or services to help with this?"
5. "What keeps you from using [current solution] more often?"

### Try It Yourself

Pick a product idea you have. Write:
- 3 bad questions (hypotheticals, leading, feature-focused)
- 3 good questions (past-focused, specific, problem-focused)

Then go interview 5 people using only the good questions.

---

## Summary: The Goal

**What you're trying to do:** Find urgent, frequent problems that people have already tried to solve.

**How to know you found it:**
- ✅ They have specific stories (at least 3)
- ✅ It happens frequently (multiple times per week/month)
- ✅ It costs them something measurable (time/money/opportunity)
- ✅ They've already tried to solve it (spent time or money)
- ✅ Current solutions fail in specific ways
- ✅ They can articulate what success looks like

**Remember:** The goal is to be RIGHT, not to feel GOOD. Bad news early saves you months of building the wrong thing.

**Next steps:**
1. Schedule 5-10 customer interviews
2. Use the techniques above
3. Document what you learn in `/docs/product/research/interviews/`
4. Look for patterns across interviews
5. Kill ideas that don't have evidence
6. Double down on validated problems

Good luck! 🎯

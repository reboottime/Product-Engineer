# Hiring Product Managers: 0→1 vs 1→10

A guide to evaluating, hiring, and working with product managers at different company stages.

## The Core Difference

**0→1 (Founding PM)**: Discovers what to build
**1→10 (Growth PM)**: Optimizes what's working

Hiring the wrong type for your stage kills momentum. A founding PM will over-experiment in growth phase. A growth PM will over-process in discovery phase.

## Mental Model Comparison

### Founding PM (0→1): Explorer Mindset

**Core question**: "Is this problem worth solving?"

**Thinking pattern**:

- Comfort with ambiguity and uncertainty
- Hypothesis-driven: "Let's test if..."
- Speed over precision: "Good enough to learn"
- Kill ruthlessly: "This didn't validate, move on"
- Qualitative over quantitative: "What did users say?"

**Daily mode**:

- Talking to customers (3-5 conversations/week minimum)
- Rapid prototyping and testing
- Pivoting based on feedback
- Cutting scope to ship faster
- Discovering patterns in small data sets

**Success looks like**:

- Finding product-market fit signals
- Invalidating bad ideas quickly
- Identifying the core value proposition
- Building minimum viable everything

**Failure looks like**:

- Building features nobody asked for
- Perfecting things before validation
- Following process over learning
- Analyzing instead of shipping

### Growth PM (1→10): Optimizer Mindset

**Core question**: "How do we improve this metric?"

**Thinking pattern**:

- Comfort with constraints and targets
- Data-driven: "The funnel shows..."
- Precision over speed: "Let's measure exactly"
- Iterate systematically: "Version 3 improved by 8%"
- Quantitative over qualitative: "What does the data say?"

**Daily mode**:

- Analyzing conversion funnels
- Running A/B tests
- Optimizing existing flows
- Building process and systems
- Scaling what's proven to work

**Success looks like**:

- Compound metric improvements (1% weekly = 67% yearly)
- Predictable experiment velocity
- Systematic optimization of funnels
- Building repeatable processes

**Failure looks like**:

- Chasing vanity metrics
- Over-engineering solutions
- Paralysis by analysis
- Losing focus on core metrics

- ✅ A/B testing portfolio (10+ experiments)
- ✅ Built systems/processes for team scale
- ✅ Cross-functional leadership (worked with 5+ teams)
- ✅ Strategic roadmap experience (quarterly/annual planning)

### Phase 2: Phone Screen (30 min)

**Universal Questions** (both types):

1. **"Walk me through a product you shipped from idea to launch."**
   - Listen for: Problem → Validation → Decision-making → Outcome
   - Red flag: Can't explain why they built it
   - Green flag: Clear metrics, customer insights, tradeoffs

2. **"Tell me about a feature you decided NOT to build."**
   - Listen for: Reasoning framework, courage to say no
   - Red flag: "Built everything stakeholders asked for"
   - Green flag: Data-driven kill decision, clear prioritization

**Founding PM Specific**:

3. **"Describe your last customer discovery process."**
   - Listen for: Interview count, methodology, insights → action
   - Red flag: "I read user feedback" (passive)
   - Green flag: "I interviewed 20 users in 2 weeks, found pattern X, pivoted to Y"

4. **"How do you validate a new product idea?"**
   - Listen for: Falsifiable hypothesis, minimum viable test
   - Red flag: Build first, validate later
   - Green flag: Talk to users → prototype → test → measure → decide

**Growth PM Specific**:

3. **"Walk me through how you analyze a conversion funnel."**
   - Listen for: Metrics understanding, drop-off analysis, experiment design
   - Red flag: Vague about metrics or tools
   - Green flag: Specific funnel (e.g., "Sign-up to activation: 45% → 62% via onboarding experiment")

4. **"Tell me about your most successful optimization."**
   - Listen for: Baseline metric, hypothesis, test design, impact, scale
   - Red flag: Can't quantify impact
   - Green flag: "Improved [metric] by X% through [specific change], validated with A/B test on Y users"

### Phase 3: Work Sample (Take-home or Live)

**Founding PM Assignment** (2-3 hours):

```
You're launching a meal planning app. You have:
- 50 beta users
- Mixed feedback
- 3 months runway

Task:
1. Review user interview transcripts (provided)
2. Identify the core problem
3. Recommend: Build/Pivot/Kill
4. If Build: Write lean PRD for MVP
5. Define success metrics

Deliverable: 2-page document
```

**What you're evaluating**:

- Can they find signal in noise?
- Do they recommend minimum viable solution?
- Are success metrics leading indicators?
- Do they show ruthless prioritization?

**Founding PM Scoring**:

- ✅ **Strong**: Identifies unexpected insight, challenges assumption, cuts 80% of scope, clear validation plan
- ⚠️ **Medium**: Decent problem identification, reasonable MVP, but scope creep
- ❌ **Weak**: Builds what users asked for, no prioritization, no validation plan

**Growth PM Assignment** (2-3 hours):

```
Your SaaS product has:
- 10k monthly active users
- 30% activation rate (complete core action in Week 1)
- 50% Day 7 retention
- Funnel data provided

Task:
1. Analyze the funnel
2. Identify top 3 optimization opportunities
3. Design 1 experiment (hypothesis, variants, success criteria)
4. Estimate impact and prioritize next 90 days

Deliverable: 2-page document + spreadsheet
```

**What you're evaluating**:

- Can they read data and find insights?
- Do they prioritize by impact?
- Is experiment design rigorous?
- Can they estimate and plan systematically?

**Growth PM Scoring**:

- ✅ **Strong**: Data-driven insights, clear prioritization (ICE/RICE), rigorous experiment design, realistic estimates
- ⚠️ **Medium**: Identifies obvious opportunities, decent experiments, vague estimates
- ❌ **Weak**: Surface-level analysis, no prioritization framework, can't design valid test

### Phase 4: Onsite Interviews (3-4 hours)

**Interview 1: Product Thinking (60 min)**

**Founding PM**:

- "How would you validate [new product idea]?"
- "Design [product] from scratch"
- Listen for: Customer-centric, hypothesis-driven, MVP mindset

**Growth PM**:

- "How would you improve [metric] for [existing product]?"
- "Design an experiment to test [hypothesis]"
- Listen for: Data fluency, systematic thinking, funnel understanding

**Interview 2: Execution & Tradeoffs (60 min)**

**Both types**:

- "How do you prioritize when you have 10 features and capacity for 2?"
- "Walk me through a time you shipped something that failed. What did you learn?"
- Listen for: Framework usage (RICE/ICE), learning velocity, adaptability

**Interview 3: Cross-functional Leadership (45 min)**

**Both types**:

- "How do you work with engineering when they disagree with your decision?"
- "Describe a time you influenced without authority"
- Listen for: Collaboration skills, data-backed influence, respect for expertise

**Interview 4: Case Study (45 min)**

**Give them a real problem** your company faces:

- Founding PM: "We have 3 ideas, which should we build?"
- Growth PM: "Our retention is dropping, how would you approach this?"

**Evaluate in real-time**:

- How do they structure the problem?
- What questions do they ask?
- What frameworks do they apply?

## Working with Each Type

### Managing a Founding PM

**Give them**:

- Customer access (budget for interviews, tools)
- Fast decision cycles (daily/weekly check-ins)
- Freedom to pivot (don't lock them into roadmap)
- Small team (less coordination overhead)

**Measure them on**:

- Learning velocity (hypotheses tested per week)
- Customer conversations (5+ per week in discovery)
- Validation confidence (increasing/decreasing)
- Speed to MVP (weeks, not months)

**Warning signs**:

- Not talking to customers weekly
- Building before validating
- Over-designing MVP
- Analysis paralysis

**Support needed**:

- "What did you learn from users this week?"
- "What's the fastest way to test this?"
- "What can we cut from scope?"

### Managing a Growth PM

**Give them**:

- Clean data infrastructure
- Experiment framework/tools
- Strategic context (how this ties to north star)
- Cross-functional team alignment

**Measure them on**:

- Metric improvement (% lift in north star)
- Experiment velocity (tests shipped per month)
- Win rate (% of experiments that succeed)
- Strategic clarity (roadmap coherence)

**Warning signs**:

- Metrics not improving despite activity
- Low experiment velocity (<2/month)
- Tactical without strategy
- Building without measuring

**Support needed**:

- "What metrics moved this month?"
- "What did your experiments teach us?"
- "How does this ladder up to north star?"

## Transition Planning

### When to Switch Types

**Founding PM → Growth PM transition** happens when:

- ✅ Product-market fit signals clear (retention >40%, NPS >30)
- ✅ Repeatable user acquisition channel found
- ✅ Core value prop validated
- ✅ Usage metrics predictable
- ✅ Ready to scale 10x

**Signs you're ready**:

- Users spontaneously refer others
- Retention curves flattening (not dropping off)
- Clear winner use case emerged
- Revenue or engagement growing consistently

**Signs you're NOT ready**:

- Still pivoting monthly
- Unclear who your customer is
- Low retention (<30% Day 7)
- No repeatable acquisition

### Transition Strategies

**Option 1: Handoff**

- Founding PM moves to next 0→1 initiative
- Growth PM hired to scale proven product
- 1-month overlap for knowledge transfer

**Option 2: Evolve**

- Rare: Founding PM develops growth skills
- Requires explicit training + support
- ~20% can make this transition successfully

**Option 3: Promote & Partner**

- Founding PM becomes CPO/Head of Product
- Growth PM hired as product lead for core product
- Founding PM oversees multiple 0→1 bets

**Handoff Checklist**:

```
□ Document validated insights
□ Share user research archive
□ Transfer customer relationships
□ Brief on what failed (and why)
□ Explain current metrics baseline
□ Intro growth PM to key stakeholders
□ Define success for next 90 days
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Hire for your stage**: 0→1 needs explorers, 1→10 needs optimizers
2. **Test for mindset**: Founding PMs kill fast, Growth PMs optimize systematically
3. **Look for proof**: Founding PMs have 0→1 stories, Growth PMs have metric impact
4. **Red flags matter**: Wrong type at wrong stage kills momentum
5. **Transition deliberately**: Handoff when product-market fit is clear
6. **Support differently**: Founding PMs need customer access, Growth PMs need data infrastructure
7. **Measure what matters**: Learning velocity (0→1) vs Metric improvement (1→10)

The best PM for discovery will frustrate your growth stage. The best PM for growth will slow your discovery stage. Hire for the phase you're in, not the phase you hope to be in.

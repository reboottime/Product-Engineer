# Product Development: 0-to-1 → 1-to-10

Guide for building products from initial concept to scale. Different phases require different approaches.

## 0-to-1: Finding Product-Market Fit

**Goal:** Validate that you're solving a real problem people will pay for/use.
**Mindset:** Fast, scrappy, learning-focused. Fail cheap.

### 1. Problem Discovery

**What:** Find a real problem worth solving
**Output:** Problem hypothesis, target user segment
**Validation:** 10+ user conversations confirming pain intensity
**Key question:** "Is this problem urgent and painful enough?"

### 2. Solution Validation

**What:** Test if your solution direction resonates before building
**Output:** Landing page, mockups, or demo video + early signups/commitments
**Validation:** 40%+ conversion on landing page OR 5+ LOIs/pre-orders
**Key question:** "Will people commit before seeing the product?"

### 3. MVP Definition

**What:** Define minimum feature set that proves core value
**Output:** User story, critical path only, success metrics
**Validation:** Can be built in 2-4 weeks
**Key question:** "What's the least we can build to learn the most?"

### 4. Rapid Prototyping

**What:** Create lowest-fidelity artifact that tests hypothesis
**Output:** Clickable prototype, Wizard of Oz, or concierge MVP
**Validation:** 5+ users complete core workflow
**Key question:** "Does the core interaction work?"

### 5. Build MVP

**What:** Ship functional minimum viable product
**Output:** Working product with core feature only
**Validation:** Real users can complete job-to-be-done
**Key question:** "Can users get value without hand-holding?"

### 6. Launch & Measure

**What:** Get product into users' hands, track real behavior
**Output:** 20-100 active users, usage metrics, feedback
**Validation:** Retention >40% week-2, NPS >50, or revenue growth
**Key question:** "Are people coming back?"

### 7. Iterate or Pivot

**What:** Double down on what works, fix/cut what doesn't
**Output:** Decision to iterate features, pivot direction, or restart
**Validation:** Clear signal from data + user feedback
**Key question:** "Did we find product-market fit?"

**Repeat 0-to-1 loop until:** Weekly retention >40%, strong word-of-mouth, can't keep up with demand.

## 1-to-10: Scaling the Product

**Goal:** Grow validated product to reach more users efficiently.
**Mindset:** Systematic, polished, growth-focused.

### 8. Systematize Core Experience

**What:** Polish proven workflows, establish design system
**Output:** Component library, patterns, brand guidelines
**Validation:** Design system used across 3+ features
**Key question:** "Is our foundation scalable?"

### 9. Feature Prioritization

**What:** Choose what to build based on impact vs. effort
**Output:** Roadmap (Now/Next/Later), RICE scores
**Validation:** Features align with North Star metric
**Key question:** "What moves the needle most?"

### 10. Feature Design (Iterative)

For each new feature:

**a) UX Flow**

- Map user journey through feature
- Output: Flowchart with screens and decision points

**b) Wireframes**

- Design screen layouts and structure
- Output: Low-fidelity wireframes

**c) User Testing**

- Validate with 5+ target users
- Output: Feedback, iteration needs

**d) High-Fidelity Design**

- Create polished UI
- Output: Final designs with specs

**e) Spec & Build**

- Document behaviors, edge cases
- Output: Eng-ready specs, shipped feature

### 11. Growth & Optimization

**What:** Systematically improve acquisition, activation, retention
**Output:** A/B tests, funnel optimization, growth experiments
**Validation:** Week-over-week growth in North Star metric
**Key question:** "How do we grow faster?"

### 12. Scale Infrastructure

**What:** Build systems for quality at scale
**Output:** Design ops, templates, processes, documentation
**Validation:** Team can ship without bottlenecks
**Key question:** "Can we maintain quality while moving fast?"

## How to Use This Guide

**If you haven't found PMF:** Stay in 0-to-1. Don't scale a product nobody wants.

**If you have PMF signals:** Transition to 1-to-10. Systematize and grow.

**AI Agent Instructions:**

- Ask user which phase they're in
- Guide through steps sequentially
- Demand validation before advancing
- Flag when user should pivot or change phases

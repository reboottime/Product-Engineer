# Product Design Workflow

End-to-end process from problem to shipped product.

## Phase 1: Understand

### 1. Problem Definition
**What:** Define what problem you're solving and for whom
**Output:** Problem statement, success metrics
**Key question:** "What's the real problem?"

### 2. Research
**What:** Gather user insights and competitive intel
**Output:** User interviews, competitive analysis, data
**Key question:** "What do users actually need?"

## Phase 2: Design

### 3. Ideation
**What:** Brainstorm possible solutions
**Output:** Sketches, concepts, options
**Key question:** "What are different ways to solve this?"

### 4. UX Flow
**What:** Map the user's journey through your solution
**Output:** Flowchart showing screens and decision points
**Key question:** "How does the user move through the app?"

### 5. Wireframes
**What:** Design layout of each screen
**Output:** Low-fidelity sketches of screen structure
**Key question:** "What's on each screen and where?"

### 6. User Testing
**What:** Validate design with real users
**Output:** Feedback, insights, iteration needs
**Key question:** "Does this actually work for users?"

### 7. High-Fidelity Design
**What:** Create final visual design
**Output:** Polished UI with colors, typography, spacing
**Key question:** "What does this look like when built?"

## Phase 3: Build

### 8. Spec (Specification)
**What:** Document all details for engineering
**Output:** Behaviors, interactions, edge cases, technical requirements
**Key question:** "How does this work in every scenario?"

### 9. Handoff
**What:** Deliver designs and specs to engineering
**Output:** Design files, documentation, asset exports
**Key question:** "Does engineering have everything they need?"

### 10. Implementation Support
**What:** Work with engineers during build
**Output:** Answers to questions, design adjustments
**Key question:** "Is this being built as intended?"

## Phase 4: Ship

### 11. Launch & Iteration
**What:** Ship product and improve based on real usage
**Output:** Shipped feature, metrics, iteration plan
**Key question:** "How do we make this better?"

**Not every project needs all steps.** Small features might skip user testing or high-fidelity design. Adapt based on project size and risk.

# Product Design Fundamentals

Foundational principles for designing different product types. Understanding your product category shapes every design decision.

## Design by Product Type

Different product categories require different design priorities:

### Consumer Apps

- **Behavior triggers:** Make actions obvious and timely
- **Engagement loops:** Create reasons to return
- **Delight:** Emotional resonance and surprise

### Enterprise Apps

- **Efficiency:** Optimize for speed and bulk operations
- **Error prevention:** Guard rails and confirmations
- **Training wheels:** Progressive disclosure, guided flows

### Productivity Tools

- **Friction removal:** Minimize clicks and cognitive load
- **Flow states:** Don't break concentration
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** Power user optimization

## How to Apply

1. **Identify your product type** - Don't mix paradigms
2. **Prioritize accordingly** - Enterprise users don't need delight, consumers don't need bulk actions
3. **Test with right metrics** - Engagement for consumer, efficiency for enterprise, speed for productivity

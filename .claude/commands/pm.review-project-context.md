# Review Project Context

Use the Task tool to invoke the founding-product-manager agent to review and update product sections in Claude.md.

`subagent_type: founding-product-manager`

**Prompt**: "Update `/Claude.md` product sections (Project Context, Problem & Solution, Success Metrics, Design Principles) with latest info only.

**Remove:** Historical context, past decisions, old metrics/goals not relevant for current decisions.

**Keep:** Only what's needed to make decisions now and understand current product state.

**Format:** Follow CLAUDE.md communication rules - scannable, short, no repetition."

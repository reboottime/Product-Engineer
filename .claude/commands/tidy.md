description: Move completed tasks from todo.md to todo.completed.md
---

Move all completed tasks (marked with `[x]`) from `/for-human/tasks/todo.md` to `/for-human/tasks/todo.completed.md`.

Steps:
1. Read todo.md only
2. Find completed tasks (lines with `- [x]`)
3. Append them to todo.completed.md under today's date and their priority sections
4. Remove them from todo.md
5. Keep priority structure intact

Use today's date as the section header in todo.completed.md.
